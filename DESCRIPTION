Description: The DIFSIB package can assess differential item, bundle or test 
    functioning (DIF/DBF/DTF) in dichotomous and polytomous items using a nonparametric 
    estimation and hypothesis test. The procedures contained within DIFSIB match examinees on 
    total test score (a latent ability proxy). Nonuniform DIF, DBF, or DTF can be 
    assessed too. The package also provides a user interface for practioners to easily 
    assess DIF, DBF or DTF using the SIBTEST procedures.
